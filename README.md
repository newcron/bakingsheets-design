This is the wordpress design for bakingsheets.de (the baking blog from my wife).

# Structure
* LESS and image files are to be found in `assets`.
* template for the styleguide is found in `styleguide-template`
* js and php sourcecode is in `src/php` and `src/js`

# Build it
To build the design, you will need grunt installed. then execute in this directory:

```
npm install
grunt
```

the output will end up in the folder `app-optimized`.
